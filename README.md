# Time Series with Python
## 📄 Summary

The workshop addresses the fundamentals of time series plotting and manipulation with Python. It was designed to be lectured at the Artificial Intelligence and Computational Methods in the Social Sciences lab - QLAB PUCP. The objective is to provide the student with the fundamental knowledge to process, manage, and visualize time series databases in Python. The workshop is divided into four sessions: the first session covers an introduction to time series concepts and implementation in Python; the second session focuses on techniques for visualizing time series data using Matplotlib; the third session teaches methods for extracting time series data through web scraping techniques; and the fourth session introduces econometric methods and analysis of time series data with Python. Additionally, the workshop includes databases for practical exercises, visual aids, and an assignment to reinforce the concepts learned.
